# Tower defense

## Game Rules

The rules are very simple:

1. Enemies come from the top entry, and walks through the path to reach the bottom out.

2. You should defend your castle and build towers, so preventing enemies from entering your castle

3. There are two main types of towers (until now); Rocket Tower, and Mega Tower

4. Also the game has waves. Each wave introduce a new level of difficulty. (we only have 6 waves until now)

## Development

### Decisions

- How to load resources?

  - Use `import.meta.glob` from "vite"
  - Make a build script to make `resources.json` file
  - Make `resources.json` file

    I found that using `import.meta.glob` does make a very bad white screen at the first load. And when using vite you cannot make a build script to make `resources.json` file. So I chose to make the file manually. It's not the best solution but it works.
